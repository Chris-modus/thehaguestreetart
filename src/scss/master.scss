// Generic - This includes all the third-party CSS used throughout the site.

// Base - These are element styles — no classes or IDs. Base typography styles go here, 

// Objects - Layout partials such as .inner, .outer, footer, header etc.
   
// Components - This is mostly a cosmetic layer — this is where I included more specific styling instructions for objects. 

// Trumps - Color overrides, forced floats, and text alignment classes can go here. !important here only.
